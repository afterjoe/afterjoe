- 👋 Hi, I’m @afterjoe
- 👀 I’m interested in all things games development, specialising in Unity mechanics and development!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write a readme about me!
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate at the moment, as I'm happy with my small team
- 📫 You can't currently outside of git!
